## Setup

### Firebase

First, set up [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). Navigate to the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.

Go to the Authentication section, click "Get Started", and enable the Google sign in provider.

Then, scroll down and add your website's domain to the section of authorized domains.

Next, click "Realtime Database" on the sidebar and click "Create Database". Choose "start in locked mode" and enable the database. Navigate to the rules tab, and add in [these rules](https://reactive-comments.vercel.app/firebaserules.json).

Then, go to the project settings,

and create a new web application.

After you register the app, copy the `firebaseConfig`. You'll need this for the next step!

### Reactive

#### Using npm

If you have a bundler for your website like webpack, you can directly import the npm module.

Use

```
# for npm
npm install @maggieliu/reactive

# for yarn
yarn add @maggieliu/reactive
```

to add reactive to your website.

#### Loading from a `script` tag

If you want to load Reactive from a script tag, add this script tag to your website.

```
<script src="https://reactive-comments.vercel.app/dist/bundle.js"></script>
```

Reactive will render into a `div` with id `reactive_widget`. Place this where you want the comments and reactions to appear on your website. **If you're loading Reactive via a script tag, make sure the `div` appears before the script tag.**

```
<div id="reactive_widget"></div>
```

Then, you need to install Reactive. Use the code below either in a script tag after the script that loads Reactive, or somewhere with your javascript code.

```
reactive.install({
    /* configuration options go here */
    firebaseConfig: /* your firebaseConfig */
    page: /* an identifier for the current page, to be used in the database */
    reactions: /* a string array containing the reactions you want to be shown */
    reactionText: /* the text you want to appear above the reactions */
});
```

The `firebaseConfig` option is required, you should paste the `firebaseConfig` from the previous step here.

All the other options are optional.

The `page` option is an identifier for the current page, to be used to store reactions and comments in the database. The default is `window.location.pathname`, with a trailing slash appended if one does not exist.

The `reactions` option is a string array containing the emojis you would like to appear in the reaction widget. The default is `["😭", "😕", "😀", "🤩"]`.

The `reactionText` option determines the text that appears above the reactions. The default is `"Did you enjoy this post? Leave your reactions below!"`.

An example is shown below:

```
reactive.install({
    firebaseConfig: {
        apiKey: "apikeyfromfirebase",
        authDomain: "yourappname.firebaseapp.com",
        databaseURL: "https://yourappname-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com",
        projectId: "yourappname",
        storageBucket: "yourappname.appspot.com",
        messagingSenderId: "123456",
        appId: "1:12345:web:fd239v10fg2",
    },
    page: "homepage",
    reactionText:
        "Leave your thoughts and reactions about this post in the comments below!",
    reactions: ["🦄", "😎", "😶‍🌫️", "😼"],
});
```

Then, you should see Reactive rendered on your page! Now you have an easy to set up, easy to configure comments and reactions system.

<Reactive />
</div>
